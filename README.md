Malware Images Classification Using Deep Learning (CNN)


In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the number of malware attacks, which have caused significant financial damage to a variety of entities, including enterprises, governments, financial institutions, healthcare providers, and others. DenseMal is the name of the visually-aided malware classification system that we have developed as part of this Project. It is a system that is both quick and accurate in its classifications. We tested it on the standard malware dataset known as MalIMG. In order to guarantee that our framework is effective, we first developed a proof-of-concept implementation and then tested it in great detail. After extensive testing, it has been shown that DenseMal is capable of properly classifying malware samples, with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 99.79%, 99.81%, and 99.79%Â respectively. In addition, security engineers have access to a simple visualization tool that makes use of DenseMal, to detect and classify malware images in an appropriate manner.
